//! This module demonstrates the initialization of a consistency ring
//! using the `RingEntity` structure.

mod ring_entity; // The `ring_entity` module contains the definition and implementation
                 // of the `RingEntity` structure, which is used to track hash concentrations.

use ring_entity::RingEntity; // Brings the `RingEntity` structure from the `ring_entity` module into scope.

/// A static array representing the consistency ring.
/// 
/// # Details
/// - The array is of size `u16::MAX + 1` (65,536 elements).
/// - Each element is initialized to a new instance of `RingEntity` using its default constructor.
/// - The `pub` modifier makes the array accessible from other modules.
///
/// # Usage
/// The `RING` array is used to track the distribution of hashes across the consistency ring.
pub static RING: [RingEntity; u16::MAX as usize + 1] = [RingEntity::new(); u16::MAX as usize + 1];
